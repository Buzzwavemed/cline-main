# Project Brief: Cline VSCode Extension

## Overview
Cline is a VSCode extension that provides an autonomous coding agent directly in the IDE. It's capable of creating and editing files, running commands, using the browser, and more, with user permission at every step. The extension integrates with various language models (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) to provide AI-powered coding assistance.

## Core Functionality
- **Autonomous Coding Agent**: Cline can understand and execute complex coding tasks
- **Tool Usage**: Can create/edit files, run commands, search code, and more
- **Browser Integration**: Can launch and interact with web browsers
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support**: Extends capabilities through MCP servers
- **Checkpoint System**: Tracks changes to workspace for safety and rollback
- **Custom Instructions**: Allows users to customize Cline's behavior

## Target Users
- Software developers of all experience levels
- Teams looking to streamline development workflows
- Individuals learning to code who need assistance

## Key Goals
1. Provide a seamless AI coding assistant experience in VSCode
2. Ensure user control and transparency in all operations
3. Support a wide range of language models and providers
4. Enable extensibility through the Model Context Protocol
5. Maintain high code quality and security standards

## Success Criteria
- Intuitive user experience with minimal friction
- Reliable execution of coding tasks
- Extensible architecture that can adapt to new AI capabilities
- Strong documentation and community support
