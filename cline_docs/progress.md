## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Context Window Limitations**: Large projects can exceed context window limits, requiring better truncation strategies.
2. **Browser Tool Stability**: Browser automation can be unstable on certain platforms or with specific websites.
3. **Terminal Output Parsing**: Complex terminal output can sometimes be difficult to parse and present clearly.
4. **Performance with Large Files**: Operations on very large files can cause performance issues.
5. **Model-specific Behaviors**: Different language models may respond differently to the same prompts, causing inconsistent behavior.

### User Experience Issues
1. **Learning Curve**: New users may find it challenging to understand how to effectively use all features.
2. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more helpful and actionable.
3. **Custom Instructions Complexity**: Creating effective custom instructions requires understanding of prompt engineering.
4. **Auto-approval Balance**: Finding the right balance between convenience and security in auto-approval settings.
5. **Task Resumption Clarity**: Resuming tasks after interruption could be more intuitive.

### MCP-related Issues
1. **MCP Server Management**: Managing multiple MCP servers could be more user-friendly.
2. **MCP Server Discovery**: Finding and installing MCP servers is not yet streamlined.
3. **MCP Security Model**: The security model for MCP servers needs further refinement.
4. **MCP Documentation**: More comprehensive documentation for MCP server development is needed.

## Recent Achievements

1. **Memory Bank Implementation**: Successfully implemented the Memory Bank system for maintaining context across sessions.
2. **Multi-Model Support**: Added support for various language models beyond Claude.
3. **MCP Server Ecosystem**: Expanded the MCP server ecosystem with new examples and capabilities.
4. **Documentation Improvements**: Enhanced documentation for users, contributors, and MCP server developers.
5. **Community Growth**: Built a growing community of users and contributors sharing best practices and custom instructions.

## Next Milestones

1. **Memory Bank Refinement**: Enhance the Memory Bank system with better integration and automatic updates.
2. **MCP Marketplace**: Develop a marketplace for discovering and installing MCP servers.
3. **Advanced Code Analysis**: Implement deeper code understanding and refactoring capabilities.
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete the user guide, developer documentation, and MCP server development guide.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improve response times and reduce resource usage.
