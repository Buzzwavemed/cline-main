# Active Context: Cline VSCode Extension

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the Cline project is on:

1. **Memory Bank Implementation**: Creating a structured documentation system to maintain context across sessions, allowing Cline to effectively resume work after memory resets.

2. **MCP Server Ecosystem**: Expanding the Model Context Protocol server ecosystem to enable more powerful integrations and capabilities.

3. **Multi-Model Support**: Enhancing compatibility with various language models beyond Claude, including OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, and others.

4. **Documentation Improvements**: Developing comprehensive documentation for users, contributors, and MCP server developers.

5. **Community Engagement**: Building a community of users and contributors to share best practices, custom instructions, and MCP servers.
